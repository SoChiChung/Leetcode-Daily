# thoughts

[question](https://leetcode.cn/problems/linked-list-components/)

remember the program is supposed to return the **number** of connected components in nums not the length of the longest connected components!

# steps

1. use a set to restore the value in nums
2. traverse the linked list ,record the amount of Linked List Components
